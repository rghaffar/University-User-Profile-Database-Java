# University User Profile Database

# Project Description
This application was created for a semester-long assignment in the Object Oriented Programming I course at the University of Baltimore, taught by Professor Giovanni Vincenti 
The application allows users to create a new user profile, edit information, or display information about the profile stored
Up to 5 profiles are stored in an array as objects within the Person class
The Person class is a parent class that contains Faculty, Staff, and Student subclasses and attributes common to all subclasses
The Faculty class contains Full-Time and Part-Time subclasses 
The Student class contains a Tutor subclass
The main class (named Assignment 4) prompts users to create/edit/display a profile.
If users choose to create a profile, he/she enters their University position and attributes specific to that position.
The user-entered attributes, once checked for appropriateness/accuracy, are stored in an object for display and editing
